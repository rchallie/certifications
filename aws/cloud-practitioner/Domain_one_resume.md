### How AWS Cloud allow customer to focus on operational value:
- Give many services
- Allow the user to focus on app not on infrastructure
## AWS Cloud and economic aspects:
### Content of the total cost of ownership proposal:
- OpEx (Functionnary costs): current charges
-  CapEx (Investment): investment for long term
- On-site operations labor costs: few needs = doesn't require fat on-site infrastructure
- Software Licence: pay for use, update, maintenance, support.
### How reduct costs when using the cloud
- Infrastructure with an adapted size
- Automation advantages:
	- Reduce costs
	- Redirect productivity
	- Disponibility
	- Fiability
- Scope of conformity: Reform used data to don't spend time / money on certifications
- Managed services: Use it to don't have to do it
